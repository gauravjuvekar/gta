Conclusion :-
Despite obtaining a set of maximal matchings, there were a lot of constraints that were considered initially. To make the algorithm work smoothly. After the execution of the algortihm we can easily obtain a set of maximal points that give us the best way two people can carpool in the most optimum way, which again depends on the threshold value which for exerimentation purposes we have kept as one.
Future Scope:-
However, there is still a lot more potential in this area. 
First, if infact keeping the vehicle capacity as 2 fixed, the user should be given the authority of selecting the vehicle capacity, as this brings a lot of changes to the final algorithm.
The other way this algorithm can be extented is by not keeping one common destination for all the nodes. Keeping this factor, the algorithm needs to be tweaked accordingly.
This is just a small little solution to the huge problem existing for finding the most optimum and the efficient means of carpooling to save petrol and reduce pollution.
